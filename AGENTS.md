# Chagas Disease: Overview

Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a parasitic illness caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi*. It primarily affects people in Latin America but has become a global health concern due to migration, with cases now reported in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. The parasite is most commonly transmitted through contact with feces of infected triatomine insects (“kissing bugs”), though transmission can also occur congenitally, through blood transfusions, organ transplantation, contaminated food, or laboratory exposure.

The disease has two clinical phases: acute and chronic. The acute phase occurs shortly after infection and is often mild or asymptomatic, though some patients experience fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, or swelling at the infection site. A classic sign is Romaña’s sign, unilateral swelling of the eyelid when infection occurs near the eye. Because symptoms are nonspecific, acute Chagas disease is frequently undiagnosed.

After the acute phase, most individuals enter a prolonged chronic indeterminate phase, during which they are asymptomatic but remain infected. Over decades, approximately 20–30% of infected individuals develop chronic Chagas disease, characterized by severe cardiac, gastrointestinal, or neurological complications. The most common and serious manifestations involve the heart, including cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Digestive complications, such as megacolon and megaesophagus, can cause profound disability.

Chagas disease disproportionately affects impoverished and rural populations, reflecting social and environmental determinants such as substandard housing that facilitates vector infestation. Despite being recognized for over a century, Chagas disease remains a neglected tropical disease, with substantial morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic impact worldwide.

# Why Effective Treatments Are Limited or Unavailable

Although Chagas disease is a well-characterized infection, effective and accessible treatments remain limited. Currently, only two antiparasitic drugs—benznidazole and nifurtimox—are widely recognized for treating *T. cruzi* infection. Both drugs were developed decades ago and have significant limitations. They are most effective when administered during the acute phase, which is rarely diagnosed, and their efficacy in chronic infection—particularly in preventing cardiac disease progression—is incomplete and variable.

Adverse effects further limit treatment use. Benznidazole and nifurtimox commonly cause gastrointestinal symptoms, skin reactions, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects, leading many patients to discontinue therapy. These side effects are more frequent and severe in adults, who represent the majority of diagnosed cases. The long treatment courses, typically lasting 60 days or more, further reduce adherence.

Scientific challenges also hinder drug development. *T. cruzi* has a complex life cycle and substantial genetic diversity, making it difficult to identify universally effective drug targets. The parasite can persist at low levels in host tissues, evading immune responses and pharmacologic eradication. Additionally, reliable biomarkers for treatment success are lacking, complicating clinical trials and regulatory approval of new therapies.

Health system barriers compound these problems. In many endemic regions, limited access to diagnostics, trained clinicians, and consistent drug supply delays or prevents treatment altogether. Screening programs for pregnant individuals, blood donors, and at-risk populations are often underfunded or inconsistently implemented. Even in non-endemic countries, awareness among healthcare providers is low, resulting in missed diagnoses.

Finally, research and development efforts have historically been minimal. Compared with diseases prevalent in high-income countries, Chagas disease has attracted limited investment in novel drugs, vaccines, or improved diagnostics. As a result, patients and clinicians continue to rely on outdated therapies that fall short of addressing the full burden of the disease.

## Weak Economic Incentives to Develop Treatments

Chagas disease primarily affects low-income populations with limited market power. Pharmaceutical companies face low financial returns, high development costs, and uncertain regulatory pathways. As a result, investment in new treatments is minimal, perpetuating reliance on outdated, imperfect drugs for a neglected disease.
