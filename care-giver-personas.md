# Care‑Giver Personas for Rural Chagas Settings

---

Below are the four evidence‑grounded personas that encapsulate the most common user archetypes we identified for family caregivers of Chagas patients in rural, low‑resource communities in the Global South.  Each persona contains:

1. **Name** – A short, evocative label.
2. **Core Goal** – One sentence that captures the central aim driving their behaviours.
3. **Behavioral Summary** – Typical activities performed in the context of disease management.
4. **Primary Constraints** – The main resource, time, or social barriers we found impacting them.
5. **Design Implications** – High‑level suggestions for how design could better serve each persona.

Feel free to refer to this file when making design decisions or when building supporting interventions.

## 1. **Caretaker‑Alivia** (Grandparent‑Carer)

- **Core Goal:** *To ensure the child gets medication on time while protecting her own health.*
- **Behavioral Summary:**
  - Uses a simple pill‑box strapped to the ankle.
  - Rides a shared horse‑drawn cart to the clinic.
  - Sleeps on a family mat with no private space.
- **Primary Constraints:**
  - Limited mobility and transportation.
  - Short daily window for caregiving (≈4 hrs).
- **Design Implications:**
  - Low‑tech paper calendar ratio of dose‑times.
  - Community transport baskets or pooled rides.

## 2. **Caretaker‑Rafi** (Farm‑Worker Carer)

- **Core Goal:** *To stay productive in the fields and still tend to the sick partner.*
- **Behavioral Summary:**
  - Uses SMS reminders juxtaposed to irrigation schedule.
  - Wins local age‑based “farmer‑counselors” for drug procurement.
  - Shares a mud‑plank bed.
- **Primary Constraints:**
  - Cash‑flow constraints for transport.
  - Inconsistent electricity (for phone charging).
- **Design Implications:**
  - Partnering with agri‑co‑ops for shared transport.
  - Solar‑powered mobile charging platforms.

## 3. **Caretaker‑Elena** (Household Leader)

- **Core Goal:** *To keep her family together while meeting health‑care needs.*
- **Behavioral Summary:**
  - Manages multiple roles (wife, mother, domestic manager).
  - Earns from small‑scale farming; stores insurance of the family.
  - Relies on peer support to share information.
- **Primary Constraints:**
  - Lack of formal literacy skills.
  - Social stigma surrounding infection.
- **Design Implications:**
  - Community‑based visual aids and storytelling at local markets.
  - Peer‑support groups to reduce stigma.

## 4. **Caretaker‑Pablo** (Visual‑Learner Carer)

- **Core Goal:** *To understand the drug schedule visually so I can avoid mistakes.*
- **Behavioral Summary:**
  - Uses colour‑coded blister packs.
  - Carries a hand‑drawn schedule on palm paper.
  - Shares information during weekly village meetings.
- **Primary Constraints:**
  - Low health‑literacy but high visual engagement.
  - Information overload from multiple health workers.
- **Design Implications:**
  - Simplified pictogram‑labelled drug packs.
  - Radio and TV advisories that reproduce visual instructions.

### Suggested Next Steps

1. **Validate** these personas with brief interviews (5 min each) in a nearby village to confirm assumptions about transport availability, literacy, and stigma.
2. **Prototype** two low‑tech artifacts – a paper calendar for Alivia and color‑coded blister packs for Pablo – and conduct a usability walk‑through.
3. **Iterate** the design brief to create a Venn‑diagram of overlapping constraints when selecting technology levels for each persona.
